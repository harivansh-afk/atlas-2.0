### Overview of the mcp-auth Package

The `mcp-auth` package is a tool designed to simplify adding secure authentication to servers using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which helps AI models, like large language models, connect to external tools and APIs securely. It seems likely that `mcp-auth` makes it easier for developers to implement authentication without needing to understand complex standards like OAuth 2.1 or OpenID Connect (OIDC). It supports various identity providers, is designed to work with current and future MCP specifications, and provides a straightforward way to ensure only authorized users or agents can access resources.

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose**: Simplifies authentication for MCP servers, enabling secure connections for AI agents.
- **Compatibility**: Works with the current MCP specification and is prepared for future updates.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple identity providers like Auth0 and Keycloak, making it adaptable.
- **Ease of Use**: Offers ready-to-use code and tutorials, reducing setup complexity.
- **Controversy**: Some discussions suggest the MCP authorization spec may have limitations for enterprise use, which `mcp-auth` aims to address.

#### What Does mcp-auth Do?

The `mcp-auth` package integrates authentication into MCP servers, allowing AI agents to securely access external services like GitHub or databases. It handles the validation of access tokens (specifically JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs) issued by identity providers, ensuring that only authorized users can perform actions.

#### How to Use It

To use `mcp-auth`, you typically set up an MCP server, configure the package with an identity provider (like Auth0), and add authentication middleware to your application. The package provides code snippets and SDKs for Python and Node.js, making it easier to integrate. For example, you can set it up to check user permissions before allowing access to external APIs.

#### Requirements for Implementation

You’ll need an MCP server setup (e.g., using a framework like FastMCP), an account with a compatible identity provider, and basic knowledge of your programming environment (Python or Node.js). The package abstracts much of the complexity, so you don’t need to be an authentication expert.

### Detailed Technical Report on mcp-auth

The `mcp-auth` package is a specialized solution for adding production-ready authentication to servers implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is an open standard developed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools, APIs, and services in a standardized, secure, and reusable manner ([MCP Auth Official Site](https://mcp-auth.dev/)). As AI agents evolve from simple assistants to autonomous actors capable of tasks like managing calendars or accessing APIs, secure authentication and authorization become critical. The `mcp-auth` package addresses this by providing a plug-and-play solution that simplifies the integration of OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols into MCP servers.

#### Purpose and Context

MCP serves as a universal translation layer, allowing LLMs to interact with external systems without needing to understand their specific APIs. For instance, an AI agent might use MCP to access a user’s GitHub repository or a database. However, these interactions require robust authentication to ensure only authorized users or agents can access sensitive resources. The `mcp-auth` package streamlines this process by handling token validation and integration with third-party identity providers (IdPs), reducing the need for developers to navigate complex authentication standards.

Research suggests that the MCP authorization specification has faced criticism for lacking enterprise-grade security features, particularly for remote server deployments ([MCP Authorization Spec Critique](https://blog.christianposta.com/the-updated-mcp-oauth-spec-is-a-mess/)). The `mcp-auth` package appears to address these concerns by offering a flexible, provider-agnostic solution that aligns with both current and future MCP specifications.

#### Key Features

The `mcp-auth` package offers several features that make it a compelling choice for developers:

- **Compatibility**: It supports the current MCP specification (dated 03-26) and is the only solution designed to work with the upcoming MCP draft, ensuring future-proofing.
- **Authorization Model**: It operates as a resource server, integrating with third-party IdPs without acting as a proxy, following the latest MCP authorization draft ([MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization)).
- **Provider-Agnostic**: It works with any standards-compliant OAuth 2.1 or OIDC provider, such as Auth0, Keycloak, Logto, Asgardeo, and WSO2 Identity Server ([MCP Auth Provider List](https://mcp-auth.dev/docs/provider-list)).
- **Transition Readiness**: It supports smooth transitions to future MCP specifications by returning third-party endpoints via OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414).
- **Developer-Friendly**: It includes tutorials, utilities, and SDKs for Python and Node.js, with upcoming support for OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728).
- **Comparison with Alternatives**: Unlike proxy-based solutions, `mcp-auth` directly supports third-party IdPs and offers greater flexibility, as shown in the following table:

| Feature                            | Proxy Solutions      | MCP Auth |

| Works with 03-26 spec              | ✅                   | ✅       |
| Works with future spec             | ❌                   | ✅       |
| Supports third-party IdPs directly | ❌ (workaround only) | ✅       |
| Provider-agnostic                  | Limited              | ✅       |
| Transition-ready                   | ❌                   | ✅       |

#### Technical Architecture

The `mcp-auth` package integrates into an MCP server as a resource server, responsible for validating bearer tokens (JWTs) issued by a third-party authorization server (IdP). It does not handle the full OAuth flow (e.g., issuing tokens), which is delegated to the IdP. This separation of concerns aligns with OAuth best practices, as noted in discussions about improving MCP’s authorization model ([OAuth in MCP](https://aaronparecki.com/2025/04/03/15/oauth-for-model-context-protocol)).

The package uses JWTs for token validation, allowing the MCP server to access authentication claims (e.g., user identity, permissions) within its tools. It is designed to comply with RFC 8414 (OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata) and is preparing for RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata), ensuring alignment with evolving standards ([MCP Auth Documentation](https://mcp-auth.dev/docs)).

#### Implementation Steps

To implement `mcp-auth` in a technical project, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the MCP Server**:

   - Use a framework like FastMCP (for Python) to initialize your MCP server.
   - Example:
     ```python
     mcp = FastMCP("MyMCPServer")
     ```

2. **Configure mcp-auth**:

   - Initialize `mcp-auth` with the configuration of a third-party IdP using `fetch_server_config`. Specify the provider type as `AuthServerType.OIDC` for OIDC providers like Auth0 or `AuthServerType.OAUTH` for OAuth 2.1 providers.
   - Example for Auth0:
     ```python
     mcp_auth = MCPAuth(server=fetch_server_config('https://your-auth0-domain.auth0.com/', type=AuthServerType.OIDC))
     ```
   - Alternatively, use `fetch_server_config_by_well_known_url` if you know the metadata URL, or manually provide metadata using `AuthServerConfig` and `AuthorizationServerMetadata` for custom setups.

3. **Add Bearer Authentication Middleware**:

   - Integrate `mcp-auth` into your application framework (e.g., Starlette for Python) by adding bearer authentication middleware. This middleware validates JWTs and checks for required scopes (e.g., `read`, `write`).
   - Example:
     ```python
     app = Starlette(
         # ... your MCP server setup
         middleware=[Middleware(mcp_auth.bearer_auth_middleware("jwt", required_scopes=["read", "write"]))]
     )
     ```

4. **Access Authentication Information**:

   - Within MCP tools, access user claims (e.g., identity, permissions) using `mcp_auth.auth_info.claims`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @mcp.tool()
     def whoami() -> dict[str, Any]:
         return mcp_auth.auth_info.claims
     ```

5. **Select an Identity Provider**:

   - Choose a compatible IdP from the supported list:
     - **Logto**: Supports OAuth 2.1 and resource indicators but lacks dynamic client registration ([Logto](https://logto.io)).
     - **Keycloak**: Supports OAuth 2.1 but has limitations with resource indicators ([Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org)).
     - **Auth0**: Fully supports OAuth 2.1, metadata, and dynamic client registration, with partial resource indicator support ([Auth0](https://www.auth0.com)).
     - **Asgardeo**: Supports OAuth 2.1 and dynamic client registration ([Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo)).
     - **WSO2 Identity Server**: Similar to Asgardeo, supports OAuth 2.1 ([WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-server/)).
   - Verify provider compliance using the provider list ([MCP Auth Provider List](https://mcp-auth.dev/docs/provider-list)).

6. **Handle Custom Configurations**:
   - If the IdP’s metadata requires customization, use `transpile_data` to modify it.
   - Example:
     ```python
     fetch_server_config('<auth-server-url>', type=AuthServerType.OIDC, transpile_data=lambda data: {**data, 'response_types_supported': ['code']})
     ```

```python
import asyncio
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from mcp import FastMCP
from mcp_auth import MCPAuth, AuthServerType, fetch_server_config

# Initialize MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("MyMCPServer")

# Configure mcp-auth with Auth0
mcp_auth = MCPAuth(server=fetch_server_config('https://your-auth0-domain.auth0.com/', type=AuthServerType.OIDC))

# Set up Starlette app with mcp-auth middleware
app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware, dispatch=mcp_auth.bearer_auth_middleware("jwt", required_scopes=["read", "write"]))

# Example MCP tool to return user claims
@mcp.tool()
def whoami() -> dict[str, Any]:
    return mcp_auth.auth_info.claims

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

#### Additional Considerations

- **Standards Compliance**: The package adheres to the MCP authorization specification and supports RFC 8414, with plans to incorporate RFC 9728 for future drafts. This ensures alignment with industry standards and evolving MCP requirements.
- **SDK Support**: Python and Node.js SDKs are available, providing utilities for JWT handling, provider-agnostic integration, and detailed tutorials ([MCP Auth Documentation](https://mcp-auth.dev/docs)).
- **Enterprise Considerations**: While the MCP authorization spec has been criticized for lacking robust enterprise features, `mcp-auth` mitigates this by supporting direct IdP integration and avoiding proxy-based limitations ([MCP Authorization Spec Critique](https://blog.christianposta.com/the-updated-mcp-oauth-spec-is-a-mess/)).
- **Use Case Example**: For an AI agent accessing a user’s GitHub repository, `mcp-auth` can validate the user’s identity via Auth0, ensuring only authorized actions are performed. The `whoami` tool can return user claims to confirm permissions before executing API calls.

#### Why Choose mcp-auth?
